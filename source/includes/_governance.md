# ODPV Governance

ODPV Governance defines the terms used to describe how data products are controlled, protected, accessed, licensed, and operated.

These terms help connect data products to quality expectations, service commitments, access rules, usage rights, policies, compliance requirements, and responsibility models. They make governance visible as part of the product vocabulary instead of treating it as separate documentation.

The governance vocabulary supports trusted reuse. It helps teams describe who is accountable, what rules apply, how access works, what consumers are allowed to do, and what obligations must be followed.

Each term has one canonical ODPV name. Also known as terms help users map familiar governance, legal, operational, and technical language to the official vocabulary. Related terms show nearby concepts that are connected but should not be treated as identical.

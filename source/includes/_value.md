# ODPV Value

ODPV Value defines the terms used to describe why data products matter, where they create value, and how that value connects to business outcomes.

These terms help connect data products to use cases, objectives, KPIs, signals, gaps, opportunities, risks, and benefits. They make the vocabulary useful beyond technical metadata by linking data products to planning, prioritization, investment, and measurable impact.

The value vocabulary supports portfolio-level thinking. It helps teams describe which data products are needed, which use cases they support, what outcomes they contribute to, and where new opportunities or gaps exist.

Each term has one canonical ODPV name. Also known as terms help users map familiar business language to the official vocabulary. Related terms show nearby concepts that are connected but should not be treated as identical.
